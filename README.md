# Dens Podcast Template (still on progress)

## Attention
<br> This template relies heavily on javascript and AJAX requests don't work with the file:// protocol due to security restrictions, i.e. You need a server if your site fetches content through JavaScript. Hence, it is recommended to use a little development server with a live preview capability.

## Installation
<br>You need node.js and npm. You should probably install this globally.
```
npm install -g live-server
```
<br>Then cd to the project directory and run command
```
live-server
```
